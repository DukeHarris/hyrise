/*
 Files in this directory with the ending .json will be
 run and evaluated by src/bin/access/autosql.cpp.
 Queries in the "test"-field of this json object will be evaluated
 against the query specified in the "reference"-field.

 "prepare" defines a SQL statement that will be run before "test".
 This should be used to load tables ahead of SQL queries that use those tables. 

 "test" is expected to be an SQL string, that will be executed

 "reference" can be either a SQL string or a JSON-query, which
 will be executed and compared with the result of "test"
